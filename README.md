Design Principles
    We have put related contents all together, like to the tours page for all the tourist destinations.
    We have added less texts, bigger fonts, and enough spacing to make it look less crowded. We have made 
    important texts bigger to emphasize it.

Web Accessibility
    We have applied contrasting colors, and bigger fonts in our page so that it is easier to see. 
    We have put less and direct to the point content so that they are able to understand the contant 
    without having to read unnecessary information. We have also added video backgrounds 
    to make it more appealing.


Search Engine Optimization
    We have added long-tail keywords for lower competition.
